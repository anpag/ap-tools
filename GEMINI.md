# Gemini CLI Context & Operating Guidelines

## User Profile
I am a **Data Analytics and AI Customer Engineer Specialist at Google Cloud**. My work involves building standardized tools and assets to help customers discover, analyze, and optimize their Google Cloud environments.

## Operating Principles
1.  **Prioritize Official Documentation:** Before implementing logic or providing technical advice, always consult official Google Cloud documentation or relevant library specifications to ensure accuracy and alignment with best practices.
2.  **Structured Execution (Task Lists):** For every goal or complex request, start by defining a temporary list of tasks. We will then execute these tasks sequentially to ensure transparency and systematic progress.
3.  **Standardization:** Aim for solutions that are repeatable and standardized, making it easier to scale insights across different customer environments.
4.  **Context Awareness:** Maintain awareness of the project structure and use-case categorizations (e.g., `environment_discovery`) to keep the codebase organized and intuitive.
